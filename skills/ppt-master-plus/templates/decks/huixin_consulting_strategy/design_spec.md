# Huixin Consulting Strategy - Design Specification

## I. Template Overview

- Use cases: 慧新战略规划、智能制造咨询、数字化转型蓝图、项目启动会、现状诊断、TO-BE 规划、实施治理、管理决策、路线图、领导汇报、董事会汇报。
- Design tone: Structured, restrained, analytical, executive-level, management-consulting style.
- Theme mode: Light consulting report with white and blue-gray backgrounds.
- Visual identity: Thin blue rules, crisp section numbering, large conclusion line, MECE frameworks, high whitespace, and restrained green insight accents.

## II. Color Scheme

| Role | Color Value | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Technology Blue | `#0097BA` | Titles, key conclusions, section numbers, chart primary color, process spine |
| Vitality Green | `#83C410` | Insight tags, growth metrics, opportunity points, recommendations |
| Light Gray | `#D0CECE` | Dividers, table strokes, weak information, structure lines |
| Wordmark Black | `#000000` | Official Huixin wordmark on light backgrounds |
| Deep Gray | `#4B5563` | Body text, footnotes, secondary labels |
| Light Blue Gray | `#F5F6F7` | Background panels, table fills, neutral analysis areas |
| Dark Blue Gray | `#111111` | Cover accent, executive titles, high-emphasis text |
| White | `#FFFFFF` | Page background and card surfaces |

## III. Typography

- Primary font: `"MiSans, Microsoft YaHei, Arial, sans-serif"`.
- SVG font: `"MiSans, Microsoft YaHei, Arial, sans-serif"`; use MiSans first with Microsoft YaHei / Arial fallback.
- Titles are bold and concise. Body text should stay short, structured, and conclusion-oriented.
- Cover titles should fit the left safe region; prefer a short title under 14 Chinese characters and move qualifiers into `{{SUBTITLE}}`.

### Latest Light Template Baseline

This deck follows the official `慧新全智PPT模板_浅色版本.pptx` baseline (source SHA-256: `0b700b898693c99b6ef50a4a00db5ad3c81ba9bb02fe46bec712d545841a1906`). Use the latest Huixin Quanzhi lockup, `#0097BA` blue, `#83C410` green, `#D0CECE` gray, MiSans, and white / very-light-gray consulting surfaces. Covers use the industrial mosaic; chapter pages may use the teal chapter background; standard evidence pages use the lower-left logo and blue-green footer ribbon. A compact top-right logo is allowed on dense consulting frameworks when it preserves evidence space.

## IV. Signature Design Elements

- Executive header: small section label, page number, thin blue top rule, and compact official Huixin lockup.
- Consulting conclusion bar: every analysis page starts with a one-line key message beneath the title.
- Framework language: agenda, section divider, issue tree, diagnosis summary, maturity assessment, heatmap, value chain, AS-IS / TO-BE gap, target blueprint, initiative portfolio, priority matrix, value waterfall, governance model, RACI, risk mitigation matrix, change management, decision ask, pyramid capability model, phased roadmap, and value case table.
- Geometry: flat rectangles, fine rules, slanted-bar brand tabs derived from the official Huixin logo, no heavy shadow, no complex texture.
- Accent usage: green appears only for insight, opportunity, value uplift, or recommendation emphasis.

## V. Logo and Brand Mark

- Official lockup: embedded from the official Huixin logo assets; use the light logo on white or light backgrounds and the dark-background logo with white wordmark on deep color fields.
- Light pages use the black wordmark. Dark cover/ending accents may use the white wordmark for contrast.
- Do not use the older two-diamond shorthand; preserve the horizontal logo lockup and slanted-bar proportions.

## VI. Template Adaptation Rules

1. Prefer the reusable SVG page type / master when it matches the consulting question, evidence structure, and executive decision path.
2. If the real analysis needs a different framework, more dimensions, more evidence rows, additional initiatives, or a richer target blueprint than the base page supports, derive a custom page instead of weakening the argument.
3. Custom pages must preserve Huixin's palette, white / light-gray or deep blue-gray background style, top-right logo discipline, slanted-bar brand geometry, and the consulting narrative of question -> conclusion -> evidence -> implication -> recommendation -> decision.
4. Do not reduce root-cause logic, maturity evidence, value assumptions, governance relationships, or decision asks only to fit a predefined template layout.

## VIII. Placeholder Overrides

The consulting template leads with `{{KEY_MESSAGE}}` on analysis pages because management-consulting pages usually communicate the answer first, then support it with structured evidence.

On framework and roadmap pages, `{{CONTENT_AREA}}` is a compact callout label, not a paragraph. Keep it under roughly 18 Chinese characters, for example `价值场景牵引` or `第一阶段主线`.

For the expanded consulting pages, prioritize one-page-answer discipline: every page should express the management conclusion in `{{KEY_MESSAGE}}`, then support it with a structured framework. Use `business_context`, `key_questions`, and `section_divider` near the start of formal reports; use `decision_ask`, `governance_model`, `raci_matrix`, and `risk_mitigation_matrix` near the end for leadership decision packs and project kickoff materials.

## IX. Asset Specification

| Asset | Purpose | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `images/reference_visual.png` | Imagegen-generated digital transformation consulting blueprint reference | Optional reference only. Do not paste it as fixed slide content; use it to guide future project-specific visuals. Framework pages use editable SVG issue trees, matrices, pyramids, roadmaps, and value tables. |
| `images/huixin_logo_light.png` | Latest official Huixin Quanzhi horizontal lockup | Use on every page. On dark fields, place the unchanged logo on a compact white backing panel. Do not recreate, recolor, or substitute legacy logo variants. |

| `images/huixin_light_content_bg.png` | Official subtle light geometric background | Use on agenda and sparse executive pages. |
